# CRM Users Module

This documentation describes API handlers and CLI commands provided by this module for
others to use. It expects your application is based on the [CRM skeleton](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-skeleton)
provided by us.

## Installing module

We recommend using Composer for installation and update management.

```shell
composer require remp/crm-users-module
```

## Enabling module

Add installed extension to your `app/config/config.neon` file.

```neon
extensions:
	- Crm\UsersModule\DI\UsersModuleExtension
```

## API documentation

All examples use `http://crm.press` as a base domain. Please change the host to the one you use
before executing the examples.

All examples use `XXX` as a default value for authorization token, please replace it with the
real tokens:

* *API tokens.* Standard API keys for server-server communication. It identifies the calling application as a whole.
They can be generated in CRM Admin (`/api/api-tokens-admin/`) and each API key has to be whitelisted to access
specific API endpoints. By default the API key has access to no endpoint. 
* *User tokens.* Generated for each user during the login process, token identify single user when communicating between
different parts of the system. The token can be read:
    * From `n_token` cookie if the user was logged in via CRM.
    * From the response of [`/api/v1/users/login` endpoint](https://github.com/remp2020/crm-users-module#post-apiv1userslogin) -
    you're free to store the response into your own cookie/local storage/session.

API responses can contain following HTTP codes:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | Successful response, default value | 
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request (missing required parameters) | 
| 403 Forbidden | The authorization failed (provided token was not valid) | 
| 404 Not found | Referenced resource wasn't found | 

If possible, the response includes `application/json` encoded payload with message explaining
the error further.
